    - you will need to create your own popup with bootstrap
    - get popup and  button(page__button) with documen.querySelector
    - add a listener with addEventListener 
    - open your window after click on the button

    - make the same but with another page, and using tailwind and its documentation (https://tailwindcss.com/)
    
    notes 

        - try to use document.querySelector with id and hash(#), and to do it right you should write and id-tag to html-button. and the same to modal-structure, you'll find in tailwind documentation
        - in tailwind the popup is not hidden by default, so you'll need to hide it. And try it with javaScript
